    <h2>Why should anyone be proud being a vegetarian?</h2>
    <p>Adopting a vegetarian diet can be the perfect way to stay healthy and happy.  A vegetarian diet is a complete diet, which is associated with high consumption of fiber, vitamins C and E, folic acid, magnesium, unsaturated fat, and numerous phytochemicals. And this is why vegetarians have lower cholesterol, low blood pressure and reduced risk of heart diseases. In addition, vegetarian food is easy for the body to digest, takes lesser time to cook, is healthy and most importantly saves your money. Vegetables are vital not just for our healthy living but for the environment too.</p></div>
    <h3>Reduce risk of the No. 1 killer – Heart Disease.</h3>
    <p>Vegetarian diets tend to be naturally lower in saturated fat and cholesterol and have a higher intake of plant nutrients than most meat-based diets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetarians have been shown to have a 24% lower risk of dying of heart disease than non-vegetarians</li>
        <li>Furthermore, world-renowned physician Dr. Dean Ornish found that patients on a low-fat vegetarian diet actually reversed coronary heart disease</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cancer prevention.</h3>
    <p style="text-align: initial;">Regularly consuming a diet that contains fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with a reduced risk of some cancers. There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower overall rate of cancer compared to the general population. “Red meat and processed meat consumption is consistently associated with an increase in the risk of colorectal cancer". Reducing your risk of cancer is a great reason to eat your fruits and veggies!</p>

    <h3>Lose excess weight and keep it off.</h3>
    <p>On average, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index (a measure of body fat) than meat eaters. More than two-thirds (68.8%) of the general public are obese. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Oxford Vegetarian Study found that BMI levels are lower in vegetarians of all age groups and for both men and women.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Avoid toxic food contaminants.</h3>
        <p>Flesh foods can harbor contaminants such as hormones, herbicides and pesticides, and antibiotics. As these toxins are all fat-soluble, they concentrate in the fatty flesh of the animals. Not to mention the viruses, bacteria and parasites such as salmonella, trichinella and other worms, and toxoplasmosis parasites</p>
        
        <h3>Enjoy the diverse, colorful, and delicious world of vegetarian cuisine.</h3>
        <p> Vegetarian meals can be tasty, fast, and easy. Plus, you can make any of your favorite non-vegetarian dishes by substituting with ready-made meat alternatives. There are lots of vegetarian cook books available as well. The Down to Earth all-vegetarian Deli is perfect when you don’t have time to cook but don’t want to compromise on taste and quality.</p>
